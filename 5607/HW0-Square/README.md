The most challenging part of this homework by far was the rotation. Getting the rotation just right was something I was struggling with. I had a hard time figuring out what points to use to make a vector so I could obtain the right angle to be used. Even after that my rotations are not smooth at all and I eventually ran out of time before I could make it rotate smoothly. Overall the project was a good introduction into using opengl and refreshing my knowledge of c++.
