Question 1:

The Order Class needs CartContents which is a list of CartEntries.
Order needs to know what property holds the list of CartEntries and 
how many items are in the list. Then OrderTotal needs to know what properties
of the CartEntries contain the price and quantity values need to do the calculation.

The variables should be made private and then accessed using getters so there is more flexiblity
in case anything changes in the future.

Question 2:

In the class CartContents, change  CartEntry* items_ to std::vector<CartEntry> items_.
This will then affect how items are inserted since vector push_back will be needed to be used.
Accessing stays the same since vectors support the [] operator.

Question 3:

Add getters and setters to allow the variables to be accessed by outside of the class scope.
A getItems and setItems will be needed in Cartcontents along with getPrice, setPrice, getQuantity,
and setQuantity in CartEntry.

Question 4:

Private enforces scope on the variable so only methods inside the class can access the variable. This makes it 
so other classes have to use the getters and setters to interact with the specific variable. This allows the
interface to stay consistent and not affect any other classes while still allowing changes to be made in the
internals of the class such as changing data structures or renaming private variables.
